Creating an agent to play an Atari game using OpenAI Gym and a reinforcement learning algorithm like DDPG or PPO can be quite an involved task. The following steps outline the process for setting up such an agent using Stable Baselines3, which is a set of reliable implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms in PyTorch.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

You need to have Python, OpenAI Gym, Stable Baselines3, and PyTorch installed. You can install the necessary packages using `pip`. For instance:

```sh
pip install gym[atari]
pip install stable-baselines3[extra]
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

### Step 2: Choose an Atari Game

For this example, let's say we want to train an agent to play the game "Breakout":

```python
import gym

env = gym.make('BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4')
```

### Step 3: Preprocess the Environment

Atari games generally require some preprocessing. Stable Baselines3 offers wrappers for this purpose:

```python
from stable_baselines3.common.atari_wrappers import AtariWrapper

env = AtariWrapper(env)
```

### Step 4: Choose an Algorithm and Create the Model

Here we will choose Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) since DDPG is typically used for environments with continuous action spaces, and Atari games have discrete action spaces.

```python
from stable_baselines3 import PPO

model = PPO("CnnPolicy", env, verbose=1)
```

### Step 5: Train the Model

Now it's time to train the model. This process may take a while depending on the complexity of the game and the power of your computer:

```python
model.learn(total_timesteps=100000)
```

### Step 6: Save the Model

After training, you can save the model:

```python
model.save("ppo_breakout")
```

### Step 7: Test the Model

Finally, you can test the trained model:

```python
# Load the trained agent
model = PPO.load("ppo_breakout", env=env)

# Evaluate the agent
episodes = 5
for episode in range(1, episodes+1):
    obs = env.reset()
    done = False
    total_reward = 0
    
    while not done:
        action, _states = model.predict(obs, deterministic=True)
        obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
        total_reward += reward
        
        env.render()  # comment this line if you do not want to see the game window
        
    print(f'Episode:{episode}, Total Reward:{total_reward}')
```

### Step 8: Tweak and Optimize

Training models, especially on complex games, requires experimentation with different hyperparameters and training times to achieve optimal performance.

### Step 9: Monitoring Training

Using TensorBoard or another monitoring tool can help you track the progress of the training.

For TensorBoard with Stable Baselines3:

```python
from stable_baselines3.common.callbacks import EvalCallback, StopTrainingOnRewardThreshold

# Stop training when the model reaches the reward threshold
callback_on_best = StopTrainingOnRewardThreshold(reward_threshold=18, verbose=1)
eval_callback = EvalCallback(env, callback_on_new_best=callback_on_best, verbose=1)

model = PPO("CnnPolicy", env, verbose=1, tensorboard_log="./ppo_breakout_tensorboard/")

# Now we pass the callback to the `learn` method
model.learn(total_timesteps=100000, callback=eval_callback)
```

You can then visualize the progress with TensorBoard by running:

```sh
tensorboard --logdir ./ppo_breakout_tensorboard/
```

Remember, training a reinforcement learning model can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. Ensure you have adequate resources before you begin. The total timesteps, architecture, and the reward threshold should be adjusted according to the complexity of the task and desired performance.
